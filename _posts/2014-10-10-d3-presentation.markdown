This [presentation](http://janmilosh.github.io/d3js-presentation/) is a series of demonstrations showing the process for building a D3.js scatter plot. It is intended to be run locally with the index.html file open along-side the browser window. The code can be [cloned or downloaded from github](http://github.com/janmilosh/d3js-presentation/). Instructions for starting a server are shown in the project README.md.
