Welcome to my portfolio site! In these pages you will find descriptions and links to many of my web development projects. I've included my personal projects as well as collaborations that I've contributed to.

I've used many technologies in these projects, including:

- AngularJS
- Protractor for E2E tests
- jQuery
- D3.js
- pure JavaScript
- Firebase
- Django/Python
- Jekyll (this site)
- Vagrant
- Grunt
- Gulp
- Sass
- Prerender
- Digital Ocean/Nginx

Currently, I work primarily with AngularJS and Python (Django), but continue to explore various technologies through personal projects and tutorials. Other technologies that I've worked with that aren't represented here are the MEAN stack and Ruby/Rails.

Also included are several of my first JavaScript projects which were built in pure JavaScript (no jQuery).

All of my projects are mobile-friendly (responsive).
